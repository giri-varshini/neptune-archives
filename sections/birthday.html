            Happy 21st!  
            <br><br>
            You’re now officially a legal adult — which means:
        </p>

        <ul class="list">
            <li>Decision-making unlocked</li>
            <li>Responsibility enabled (auto-blame still allowed)</li>
            <li>Smoke, Drink and Drugs legal, haha!</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            Growing up isn’t just about being perfect.  
            It’s about being curious, making mistakes, learning back,
            and moving forward.
        </p>

            Welcome to the real game. Age isn't just a number, it's more about maturity, responsibilites, and of course fun! The world is really beautiful, don't stop exploring :)
        </p>
