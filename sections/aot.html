    <h2>Why AOT hits different</h2>

    <p>
        Some watch it for action.  
        Some for plot twists.  
        Some accidentally watch for existential crisis.
    </p>

    <p>
        AOT isn’t about titans.  
        It’s about choices, consequences, and freedom —  
        and how none of them come clean.
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li>Eren: hero, villain, or just inevitable?</li>
        <li>No character is fully right</li>
        <li>No decision is free from regret</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        If life was an anime, this would be the reminder that
        freedom isn’t loud — it’s heavy.It comes with choices, scars, and the courage to stand alone when needed.
Have no regrets in life — every step, every mistake, every pause shapes who you become.
Keep fighting (tatakai!!) for what you believe in, even when the path feels unclear.
Growth isn’t about winning every battle, but about never giving up on yourself.
Move forward, stay curious, and carry your freedom with purpose :)
