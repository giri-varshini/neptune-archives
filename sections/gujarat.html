    <h2>From Gujarat, with perspective</h2>

    <p>
        Every place shapes how people think —
        birth place always plays an important role.
    </p>

    <p>
        Gujarat known for:
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li>Strong values</li>
        <li>Serious food culture</li>
        <li>Intelligent people (like who even during casual talks bring up AI terms)</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        There’s a certain clarity that comes from
        knowing where you come from —
        it shows in how you speak, argue, and decide.
    </p>

    <p>
        This section is just a small nod
        to the place that shaped a part of you. Forever be grateful to motherland :)
