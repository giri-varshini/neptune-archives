<h2>Why science conversations are different</h2>

<p>
    Science doesn’t care about opinions?
    <br>
    Only evidence? Who told that.
</p>

<p>
    Science begins where certainty ends.
    <br>
    It lives in questions that refuse to stay quiet.
</p>

<p>
    The best conversations are the ones that:
</p>

<ul>
    <li>Start with “what if”</li>
    <li>Drift into theories, paradoxes, and contradictions</li>
    <li>End without clear answers</li>
    <li>Leave you staring at the ceiling at 2 AM</li>
</ul>

<p>
    What happens at the center of a black hole?
    <br>
    Does time stop, reverse, or collapse into something we don’t have words for?
</p>

<p>
    Is the universe infinite —
    <br>
    or are we just too small to see its edges?
</p>

<p>
    Are we alone,
    <br>
    or is intelligence scattered across the cosmos, waiting to be noticed?
</p>

<p>
    Curiosity is underrated.
    <br>
    It’s what turns ordinary conversations into unforgettable ones.

    <strong>Life lesson:</strong>
    <br>
    Stay curious. Keep learning.
    <br>
    The moment you stop asking questions,
    <br>
    the universe stops answering them. So don't forget to keep questioning :)
